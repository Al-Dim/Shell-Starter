# Shell Starter
 Shell Starter is a utility to start other applications in place of default shell of windows.

 It is created in visual basic 6.

 It can be used to launce custom shells or applications insted of windows default shell "explorer.exe".
 
 I created cause i wanted to make default starting program on my old laptop the mame emulator "mame.exe" :)

 After the application exit, the shell starter can shutdown / restart system or anything else you want.

 Hope to help you with your arcade machine or anything else you want :)

 Keep in mind that in my system, i use avast antivirus and while the executable is cleaned,
 when the program run the official windows API functions for registry manipulation:
 RegCloseKey, RegCreateKey, RegOpenKey, RegQueryValueEx, RegSetValueEx
 the behavior shield say that the shell starter has virus, which is false alarm!
 Also if you run it in visual basic 6, it will say that vb6 is infected.
 So make an exception to work propertly.
